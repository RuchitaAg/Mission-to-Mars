This repository represents a simple version of a very complex process that can be performed programmatically. 
This has the functionality to scrape desired data from a website and store them in a simple database. 
Then this data is represented in a website that is developed on purpose. As the database tool, 
here we have used MongoDB, and the main programming language is python. 
For the scraping, splinter and beautifulsoup libraries are used and to develop the website flask library is used.
